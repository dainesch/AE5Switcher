![Settings](./Docs/Settings.png?raw=true)

## How it works
- A simple tray icon is added that can be double clicked to switch modes and adapt the system volume
- The switch is done via mouse control of the Sound Blaster Connect application, nothing fancy
- The current mode (Speaker or Headphone) is detected via the current system volume and based on the settings of the volume for the different modes
